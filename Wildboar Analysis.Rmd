## Introduction 
Agricultural crops provide an optimal and easily accessible food source for wild boar (Sus scrofa). Therefore, wild boar can cause damage of crop fields, which leads to financial damage. Since the damage of these fields caused conflicts with farmers, scare-off measures were developed, implemented, and monitored. This study aims to analyse, with the program R, the statistical success rate of the scare-off measures. 

### Research questions

## Data and Methods

### Data
The data was collected within the scope of a project 


### Pre-processing 
calculated times for dawn and dusk for every day each Schreck was running
calculated distance of wild boar to scare off measures

### Methods


### Limitations



## Results
```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(readr)        # to import tabular data (e.g. csv)
library(dplyr)        # to manipulate (tabular) data
library(ggplot2)      # to visualize data
library(lubridate)    # To handle dates and times
devtools::install_github("ComputationalMovementAnalysis/ComputationalMovementAnalysisData") # getting data from R Package
library(ComputationalMovementAnalysisData) #Wild boar data is on that package
